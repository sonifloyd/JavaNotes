What is a Class?
A Class is a blueprint or template that defines how objects are created and what properties and behaviors they will have.

In simple terms:

Class = Design/Blueprint
Object = Actual item created from that blueprint
ðŸ”‘ Syntax of Class:
java
Copy
Edit
class Car {
    // Properties (Variables)
    String brand;
    int speed;

    // Behavior (Methods)
    void drive() {
        System.out.println(brand + " is driving at " + speed + " km/h");
    }
}
âœ… What is an Object?
An Object is an instance of a Class that holds the actual data and performs actions.

ðŸ‘‰ How to create an object?

java
Copy
Edit
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car(); // Object creation
        myCar.brand = "BMW";
        myCar.speed = 120;

        myCar.drive(); // Calling method
    }
}
ðŸ”‘ Output:
bash
Copy
Edit
BMW is driving at 120 km/h
ðŸŽ¯ Main Differences:
Class	Object
Blueprint	Real-world entity
Doesn't occupy memory	Occupies memory
Used to define properties and methods	Used to access properties and methods
Example: Car	Example: BMW, Audi
ðŸ’¡ Important Points:
You can create multiple objects from one class.
Every object has different values but follows the same structure.
Without a class, you cannot create objects in Java.
